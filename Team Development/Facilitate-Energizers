# Energizers 
Energizers are a fast way to bring up the energy level in a live space and set the tone for the next activity or discussion. All of these activities only require people and space, unless otherwise noted. We've provided a few examples below that have helped Hubbers kick off Mini-summits, retros, brainstorming, etc. 

## Get a Handle (10 minutes)
In groups of 5 - 6, introduce yourself. Share the story behind your GitHub handle. If it’s your name, share the story of your actual name (i.e., are you named after someone, do you have a unique spelling, etc.)

## Common Ground (10 minutes)
In groups of 5, introduce yourself to the group and find 3 things you all have in common. They cannot be obvious things such as, “We’re all wearing pants!” Dig deeper. Nominate a spokesperson to share the themes back. Points for the most creative responses. 
Optional round: Combine two groups together and find 3 more things you all have in common - but you cannot use anything you used in a prior round. 

## Clap, Snap, Stomp. (10 minutes)
Designed to mess you up - have fun, celebrate failures, connect, laugh. 
- Ideally do a demonstration first with one of the participants (ie someone who has never played this before), and talk them through it as you go. This way the group will have an idea of how the game goes when you begin.
- Get everyone into pairs facing each other.
- Instruct partners to begin counting alternately 1 – 2 – 3 over and over again.
- As they are counting (maybe give them 15 seconds or so for each level), ask them to replace the “1” with a clap, while 2 and 3 stay the same.
- Then ask them to replace the “2” with a snap, so “1” is clap, “2” is a snap, and “3” is 3.
- Then ask them to replace the “3” with a stomp, so “1” is clap, “2” is a snap, and “3” is a stomp.
Challenge participants to go as fast as possible and watch their brains try to keep up!

## Will the real Hubber please stand up? (5 minutes)
Facilitator to read a list of statements and Hubbers to stand or sit depending on if they agree with the statement. For example: Stand up if you ….
- Took a plane to get here. 
- Have been at GitHub longer than a month… than a year… than 2 years… than 3 years.. 
- Work from a coworking space 
- Work out of a GitHub office
- Work primarily from your home.
- Have had more than one manager at GitHub. 
- Have ever had a moment at GitHub where you felt like you don’t belong. 
- Have randomly slacked another Hubber to introduce yourself.
- Live in a country other than the country where you were born.
- Speak one language … 2 languages … 3 languages … 4 languages … more than 4!
- Your first language was not English.

## If you really, really knew me… (5 minutes)
In groups of 3, introduce yourself and share 3 quick things. One obvious fact, one fun fact, and one thing that others might not otherwise know or get a chance to learn about you. Start each sentence with “If you really, really knew me, you would know ….”

## Pass the Rhythm (5 minutes)  
Designed to bring the energy back into a room after a meal or other lull, encouraging participants to focus on eachother and collaboration. This works best with groups larger than 10 people. 
- Get the group into a circle so that everyone can see each other.
- The goal is to be in sync with each other as a rhythmic clap is passed around the circle.
- Two people next to each other will start by turning towards one another, making eye contact and clapping at the exact same time.
- Then one person will turn to the next person on the other side and make eye contact with him/her, clapping at the exact same time.
- Keep passing the rhythm around the circle, picking up speed and establishing a steady cadence.
- Let the rhythm go around the circle a few times until the group has it down.
- Then you can add another element of fun and difficulty. Instruct the group "for the next round, two people can make eye contact and a spontaneous silent agreement to switch places in the circle, trying to arrive in each other’s place before the rhythm comes around to them." Ideally when people move, they are balancing taking a risk, with making sure the rhythm doesn’t get disturbed or interrupted by their switching places.
- Multiple people may make eye contact and switch places at the same time, so watch out for traffic jams in the middle of the circle!
- Keep going around the circle a few times, encouraging people to take more risk in the switching of places while maintaining a steady rhythm.

## Inclusive Venture's Brave Space Norms + Inclusive Language 
A great way to kick off any gatheing of Hubbers is to create a Brave Space for dialogue. One way to create the space is to open up the discussion with "Norms" or best practices for everyone to consider from the start. This [doc](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TP52yUOgu1TwxPbLk5-YYwbYymrbjcvq/view) shares a list of our favorites, as well as inclusive language to encourage as well.
