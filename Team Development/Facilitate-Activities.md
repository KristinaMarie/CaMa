## User Manual Design & Share 
- **Duration**: 90 minutes 
- **Facilitator**: Anyone looking to bring a new group of Hubbers together with the goal of self reflection and better collaboration. 
- **Workshop Overview**: During this workshop, team members will be able to brainstorm items they would like to include on their “User Manual” aka “Guide for Working With Me”.

## New Leader Integration 
- **Duration**: 90 minutes
- **Facilitator**: Senior team member or HR Business Partner 
- **Workshop Overview**: New Leader Integration is a 90 minute workshop designed to help new leaders learn about what's top of mind for the team. This includes leaders who recently: A) joined GitHub and inherited a team, or B) moved from an individual contributor peer to manager role. The facilitator's role is to help the team anonymously surface questions, concerns and ideas to the new leader in a safe way, while gifting the new leader with information that may otherwise take weeks or months to learn.
- **Prep Material**: Facilitators can utilize the ["New Leader Integration"](https://degreed.com/paths?path=new-leader-integration---github-l-d&id=81122) learning pathway in Degreed. This does require some advance prepwork from all participants leading up to the live discussion. 

## Team Purpose Workshop 
- **Duration**: 3 hours 
- **Facilitator**: Team manager or L&D 
- **Workshop Overview**: Having a purpose means we feel a commitment to something bigger than ourselves. It also helps us, and other Hubbers, understand why our team exists. In this 3 hour workshop will take your team through a mix of interactive exercises designed to help you craft a clear purpose statement defining the “why” behind your team’s existence at GitHub.
- **Prep Material**: Facilitators can utilize the ["Crafting Your Team's Purpose Statement"](https://degreed.com/paths?path=crafting-your-team-s-purpose-statement&id=102297) learning pathway in Degreed. This does require some advance prepwork from all participants leading up to the live workshop.
